</li></ul></div><p>Hello everyone! We&rsquo;re excited to announce our first public Apple Silicon GPU driver release!</p><p>We&rsquo;ve been working hard over the past two years to bring this new driver to everyone, and we&rsquo;re really proud to finally be here. This is still an alpha driver, but it&rsquo;s already good enough to run a smooth desktop experience and some games.</p><p>Read on to find out more about the state of things today, how to install it (it&rsquo;s an opt-in package), and how to report bugs!</p><p><img src=/img/blog/2022/12/quake3.png alt="Quake 3 Arena running on an Apple M1"></p><h1 id=status>Status</h1><p>This release features work-in-progress OpenGL 2.1 and OpenGL ES 2.0 support for all current Apple M-series systems. That&rsquo;s enough for hardware acceleration with desktop environments, like GNOME and KDE. It&rsquo;s also enough for older 3D games, like Quake3 and Neverball. While there&rsquo;s always room for improvement, the driver is fast enough to run all of the above at 60 frames per second at 4K.</p><p>Please note: these drivers have not yet passed the OpenGL (ES) conformance tests. There will be bugs!</p><p>What&rsquo;s next? Supporting more applications. While OpenGL (ES) 2 suffices for some applications, newer ones (especially games) demand more OpenGL features. OpenGL (ES) 3 brings with it a slew of new features, like multiple render targets, multisampling, and transform feedback. Work on these features is well under way, but they will each take a great deal of additional development effort, and all are needed before OpenGL (ES) 3.0 is available.</p><p>What about Vulkan? We&rsquo;re working on it! Although we&rsquo;re only shipping OpenGL right now, we&rsquo;re designing with Vulkan in mind. Most of the work we&rsquo;re putting toward OpenGL will be reused for Vulkan. We estimated that we could ship working OpenGL 2 drivers much sooner than a working Vulkan 1.0 driver, and we wanted to get hardware accelerated desktops into your hands as soon as possible. For the most part, those desktops use OpenGL, so supporting OpenGL first made more sense to us than diving into the Vulkan deep end, only to use Zink to translate OpenGL 2 to Vulkan to run desktops. Plus, there is a large spectrum of OpenGL support, with OpenGL 2.1 containing a fraction of the features of OpenGL 4.6. The same is true for Vulkan: the baseline Vulkan 1.0 profile is roughly equivalent to OpenGL ES 3.1, but applications these days want Vulkan 1.3 with tons of extensions and &ldquo;optional&rdquo; features. Zink&rsquo;s &ldquo;layering&rdquo; of OpenGL on top of Vulkan isn&rsquo;t magic: it can only expose the OpenGL features that the underlying Vulkan driver has. A baseline Vulkan 1.0 driver isn&rsquo;t even enough to get OpenGL 2.1 on Zink! Zink itself advertises support for OpenGL 4.6, but of course that&rsquo;s only when paired with Vulkan drivers that support the equivalent of OpenGL 4.6&mldr; and that gets us back to a tremendous amount of time and effort.</p><p>When will OpenGL 3 support be ready? OpenGL 4? Vulkan 1.0? Vulkan 1.3? In community open source projects, it&rsquo;s said that every time somebody asks when a feature will be done, it delays that feature by a month. Well, a lot of people have been asking&mldr;</p><p>At any rate, for a sneak peek&mldr; here is SuperTuxKart&rsquo;s deferred renderer running at full speed, making liberal use of OpenGL ES 3 features like multiple render targets~</p><p><img src=/img/blog/2022/12/supertuxkart-dr.png alt="SuperTuxKart&amp;rsquo;s deferred renderer running on an Apple M1"></p><h1 id=anatomy-of-a-gpu-driver>Anatomy of a GPU driver</h1><p>Modern GPUs consist of many distinct &ldquo;layered&rdquo; parts. There is&mldr;</p><ul>
<li>a memory management unit and an interface to submit memory-mapped work to the hardware</li><li>fixed-function 3D hardware to rasterize triangles, perform depth/stencil testing, and more</li><li>programmable &ldquo;shader cores&rdquo; (like little CPUs with bespoke instruction sets) with work dispatched by the fixed-function hardware</li></ul><p>This &ldquo;layered&rdquo; hardware demands a &ldquo;layered&rdquo; graphics driver stack. We need&mldr;</p><ul>
<li>a kernel driver to map memory and submit memory-mapped work</li><li>a userspace driver to translate OpenGL and Vulkan calls into hardware-specific data structures in graphics memory</li><li>a compiler translating shading programming languages like GLSL to the hardware&rsquo;s instruction set</li></ul><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of work, calling for a team effort! Fortunately, that layering gives us natural boundaries to divide work among our small team.</p><ul>
<li><a href=https://social.treehouse.systems/@alyssa>Alyssa Rosenzweig</a> is writing the OpenGL driver and compiler.</li><li><a href=https://vt.social/@lina>Asahi Lina</a> is writing the kernel driver and helping with OpenGL.</li><li><a href=https://mastodon.social/@dougall>Dougall Johnson</a> is reverse-engineering the instruction set with Alyssa.</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, <a href=https://tech.lgbt/@ella>Ella Stanforth</a> is working on a Vulkan driver, reusing the kernel driver, the compiler, and some code shared with the OpenGL driver.</p><p>Of course, we couldn&rsquo;t build an OpenGL driver in under two years just ourselves. Thanks to the power of free and open source software, we stand on the shoulders of FOSS giants. The compiler implements a &ldquo;NIR&rdquo; backend, where NIR is a powerful intermediate representation, including GLSL to NIR translation. The kernel driver users the &ldquo;Direct Rendering Manager&rdquo; (DRM) subsystem of the Linux kernel to minimize boilerplate. Finally, the OpenGL driver implements the &ldquo;Gallium3D&rdquo; API inside of <a href=https://mesa3d.org/>Mesa</a>, the home for open source OpenGL and Vulkan drivers. Through Mesa and Gallium3D, we benefit from thirty years of OpenGL driver development, with common code translating OpenGL into the much simpler Gallium3D. Thanks to the incredible engineering of NIR, Mesa, and Gallium3D, our ragtag team of reverse-engineers can focus on what&rsquo;s left: the Apple hardware.</p><h1 id=installation-instructions>Installation instructions</h1><p>To get the new drivers, you need to run the <code>linux-asahi-edge</code> kernel and also install the <code>mesa-asahi-edge</code> Mesa package.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ sudo pacman -Syu
$ sudo pacman -S linux-asahi-edge mesa-asahi-edge
$ sudo update-grub
</code></pre><p>Since only one version of Mesa can be installed at a time, pacman will prompt you to replace <code>mesa</code> with <code>mesa-asahi-edge</code>. This is normal!</p><p>We also recommend running Wayland instead of Xorg at this point, so if you&rsquo;re using the KDE Plasma environment, make sure to install the Wayland session:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>$ sudo pacman -S plasma-wayland-session
</code></pre><p>Then reboot, pick the Wayland session at the top of the login screen (SDDM), and enjoy! You might want to adjust the screen scale factor in <em>System Settings → Display and Monitor</em> (Plasma Wayland defaults to 100% or 200%, while 150% is often nicer). If you have &ldquo;Force font DPI&rdquo; enabled under <em>Appearance → Fonts</em>, you should disable that (it is saved separately for Wayland and Xorg, and shouldn&rsquo;t be necessary on Wayland sessions). Log out and back in for these changes to fully apply.</p><p>Xorg and Xorg-based desktop environments should work, but there are a few known issues:</p><ul>
<li>Expect screen tearing (this might be fixed <a href=https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/-/merge_requests/1006>soon</a>)</li><li>VSync does not work (some KDE animations will be too fast, and GL apps will not limit their FPS even with VSync enabled). This is a limitation of Xorg on the Apple DCP display controllers, which do not support VBlank interrupts.</li><li>There are still driver bugs triggered by Xorg/KWin. We&rsquo;re looking into this.</li></ul><p>The <code>linux-asahi-edge</code> kernel can be installed side-by-side with the standard <code>linux-asahi</code> package, but both versions should be kept in sync, so make sure to always update your packages together! You can always pick the <code>linux-asahi</code> kernel in the GRUB boot menu, which will disable GPU acceleration and the DCP display driver.</p><p>When the packages are updated in the future, it&rsquo;s possible that graphical apps will stop starting up after an update until you reboot, or they may fall back to software rendering. This is normal. Until the UAPI is stable, we&rsquo;ll have to break compatibility between Mesa and the kernel every now and then, so you will need to reboot to make things work after updates. In general, if apps <em>do</em> keep working with acceleration after any particular Mesa update, then it&rsquo;s probably safe not to reboot, but you should still do it to make sure you&rsquo;re running the latest kernel!</p><h1 id=reporting-bugs>Reporting bugs</h1><p>Since the driver is still in development, there are lots of known issues and we&rsquo;re still working hard on improving conformance test results. Please don&rsquo;t open new bugs for random apps not working! It&rsquo;s still the early days and we know there&rsquo;s a lot of work to do. Here&rsquo;s a quick guide of how to report bugs:</p><ul>
<li>If you find an app that does not start up at all, please don&rsquo;t report it as a bug. Lots of apps won&rsquo;t work because they require a newer GL version than what we support. Please set the <code>LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1</code> environment variable for those apps to fall back to software rendering. If it is a popular app that is part of the Arch Linux ARM repository, you can make a comment on <a href=https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/issues/73>this issue</a> instead, so we can add Mesa quirks to workaround.</li><li>If you run into issues caused by <code>linux-asahi-edge</code> unrelated to the GPU, please add a comment to <a href=https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/issues/70>this issue</a>. This includes display output issues! (Resolutions, backlight control, display power control, etc.)</li><li>If the GPU locks up and all GPU apps stop working, run <code>asahi-diagnose</code> (for example, from an SSH session), open a new bug on <a href=https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux>AsahiLinux/linux</a>, attach the file generated by that command, and tell us what you were doing that caused the lockup.</li><li>For other GPU issues (rendering glitches, apps that crash after starting up correctly, and things like that), run <code>asahi-diagnose</code> and make a comment on <a href=https://github.com/AsahiLinux/linux/issues/72>this issue</a>, attaching the file generated by that command. Don&rsquo;t forget to tell us about your environment!</li><li>In the future, if a driver update causes a regression (rendering problems or crashes for apps that previously worked properly), you can open a bug <a href=https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/asahi/mesa/-/issues>directly in the Mesa tracker</a>.</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoy our driver! Remember, things are still moving quickly, so make sure to update your packages regularly to get updates and bug fixes!</p><div class=post-bottom>Alyssa Rosenzweig & Asahi Lina · <span class=publishdate>2022-12-07</span></div></div></div></section><script>document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",function(){document.referrer.match("//news.ycombinator.com")&&(document.body.ariaHidden=!0,document.body.classList.add("hnsucks"),document.body.innerHTML="<style>body {    padding: 20px;}body p {    margin-bottom: 20px;}.hnsucks a {    text-decoration: underline;}</style><p>Hi! It looks like you might have come from Hacker News.</p><p>We're going to be blunt: Hacker News is increasingly a haven for alt-right trolls and hateful abusers, and the administrators have demonstrated that they have no interest in improving the situation despite repeated pleas by multiple people, in public and in private, even going as far as deploying countermeasures to prevent us from blocking HN traffic*. A significant number of Hacker News commenters have repeatedly directed harassment, abuse, doxxing, and bigotry at multiple Asahi Linux developers, and much of this content remains available and not flagged or downvoted.</p><p>This may surprise you as a HN user, since overly hateful content is indeed often flagged and not immediately visible in HN top-level comment sections. While this is true, there is a major flaw in the HN moderation mechanism that enables abuse to continue unabated. This is the fact that, when a comment is flagged and killed, its child subthread is not. Once the high-level comment is no longer visible in the top-level comment section by default, this significantly reduces moderation activity in the subthread, as users are less likely to click to expand it. The deeper you go, the less likely it is for content to be moderated. Entire subthreads with dozens of comments are spawned, both abusive content and anti-abusive content that serves to feed the trolls, and it is rare for any of the child comments to be ultimately killed and hidden. The original comment being flagged/hidden becomes completely irrelevant, as the context provided by the replies sends the same message (sometimes, an outright quote exists with the exact flagged content). This completely defeats the moderation system, merely slightly reducing the exposure of the abuse but allowing it to continue with impunity.</p><p>At the time of this writing, a recent HN subthread of a killed comment contained replies including comparisons between an Asahi Linux developer and Hans Reiser, direct support for Kiwi Farms, doxxing content, and general insults and abusive assertions. These comments were at most slightly downvoted by the community, but still readable and not in any way killed or hidden by default. These threads pop up more often than not on Asahi Linux discussions on Hacker News; previous comments that again remain unkilled to this day include transphobic abuse, allegations of mental illness, etc. We have brought up some of this content to Hacker News administrators directly, and they have chosen to ignore it (abusive content we reported almost a year ago remains up and unflagged/unkilled to this day).</p><p>We believe that this pattern is the result of explicit, organized abuse perpetrated by a group of users overlapping with communities like Kiwi Farms (this is evidenced by the talking points used and certain style patterns we will not explicitly describe here that are a hallmark of that website's users). These people seek to harass others until their <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_(programmer)'>life is destroyed</a>. It is not low-level trolling, but rather an organized and directed effort to hurt and destroy people. Multiple lives have been <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms#Suicides_of_harassment_targets'>lost</a> to this kind of abuse already.</p><p>Hacker News being susceptible to this kind of content is particularly dangerous. By being a highly-ranked website, and thanks to the abuse subthreads being crawlable and easily reached by search engines, this provides an avenue to seed hateful content that ranks highly in Google searches for our project and its developers, even when not directly visible from top-level HN comment sections. Google's algorithm has even used this content to seed abusive 'answers' about our project and its developers at some points. Most of the time, this kind of content is limited to sites (like 4chan) that rank poorly and are not trusted by such services, but HN is different and provides a backdoor for trolls and abusers to make their content highly visible.</p><p>In addition, Hacker News administrators regularly engage in moderation practices that exacerbate the problem, such as detaching bad comment threads from their parent and burying them at the bottom of the comments page. This practice seeks to preserve the 'clean' image of the community by ensuring that the vast majority of visitors never stumble upon the toxic threads and they are not easily findable for a casual observer, but in fact further undermines ongoing community moderation and leaves the threads fully indexable by search engines open to further replies and toxic discussion, all hidden from most public view as a safe haven for abuse. This is at best shortsighted and represents a clear lack of understanding of the responsibilities of a competent moderation team and framework for a website as notable and highly ranked as Hacker News.</p><p>By letting this abuse run undeterred, Y Combinator and Daniel Gackle are tacitly approving of this conduct and hurting the reputation of the entire site and its userbase. If you want to support us and what we do and you are a Hacker News user, please bring this up and demand change within the community.<br><br>As things stand today, we consider Hacker News traffic to be a net negative for the project, and we kindly ask you to move on to the next story.</p><br><br><p>To Daniel: I <a href='https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbz4b/what-i-learned-from-near-an-emulation-legend-and-real-person'>lost a friend</a> to this kind of harassment. I had to go to the police station to testify about the online abuse they suffered, after police confirmed they found them hung in their apartment that morning. This happened after the Asahi Linux project started. One of the things they told me on our last conversation a few weeks prior was that they wanted to try to contribute to Asahi Linux. They never got the chance. If you have the slightest bit of humanity, please take this stuff seriously. It's not a joke. People actually die. -marcan<p>* Historical note: At the time this message was first written, Hacker News had begun tagging links <i>specifically to asahilinux.org</i> with <code>rel=noreferrer</code>. They later extended this policy to all outgoing article links, in an attempt to mask their obvious targeting of us. This forced us to resort to less-accurate CSS-based methods to display this message. Daniel himself <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36231387' rel='nofollow'>admitted to being behind this change</a>. They have since reverted this policy, and we are once again checking the referrer.</p>")})</script>
