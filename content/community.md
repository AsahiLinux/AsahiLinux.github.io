Most development and project discussion takes place on IRC. We have several channels on the Freenode IRC network:

* #asahi-dev [[logs](https://freenode.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-dev) 路 [matrix](https://matrix.to/#freenode_#asahi-dev:matrix.org)] - Development discussion
* #asahi-re [[logs](https://freenode.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-re) 路 [matrix](https://matrix.to/#freenode_#asahi-re:matrix.org)] - Reverse engineering (hardware/firmware interfaces/etc)
* #asahi-gpu [[logs](https://freenode.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-gpu) 路 [matrix](https://matrix.to/#freenode_#asahi-gpu:matrix.org)] - GPU reverse engineering and development

Even if you don't plan to speak, feel free to join and idle in the above channels if you'd like to follow the discussion.

There is also a [Matrix to Freenode bridge](https://matrix.org/blog/2015/06/22/the-matrix-org-irc-bridge-now-bridges-all-of-freenode) that you can use to join the above channels from Matrix. You can click the links labelled 'matrix' to join the respective rooms.
