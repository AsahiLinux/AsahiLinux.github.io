# Community

If you're interested in the project, you're welcome to drop by!  Check out [ways in which you can contribute](/contribute).

Please remember that all community members are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## IRC

Most development and project discussion takes place on IRC. We have several channels on the OFTC IRC network:

* #asahi [[logs](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi)] - General project discussion
* #asahi-dev [[logs](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-dev)] - Development discussion
* #asahi-re [[logs](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-re)] - Binary decompilation/tainted discussion
* #asahi-gpu [[logs](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-gpu)] - GPU reverse engineering and development
* #asahi-alt [[logs](https://oftc.irclog.whitequark.org/asahi-alt)] - Discussion and support for unofficial third-party distro ports
* #asahi-stream - Chatroom for people to talk during the devs' video streams

Even if you don't plan to speak, feel free to join and idle in the above channels if you'd like to follow the discussion.

**Note: Due to spambot attacks, we currently only allow users connecting with TLS to join the channels. Please make sure your IRC client is set to enable TLS and connect to irc.oftc.net on port 6697**.
