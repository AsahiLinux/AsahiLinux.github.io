# Support Asahi Linux

The Asahi Linux project is funded by individuals like you. If you would like to support us financially, head over to our project [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/asahilinux) or to our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/AsahiLinux). You can also [buy Asahi Linux merch](/merch), which supports the project with each sale.

Porting Linux to Apple Silicon is no small task. Financial support will allow
us to buy hardware and fund contributors, allowing the project to advance at a
steady pace and ensure that everything is paid the proper attention.
