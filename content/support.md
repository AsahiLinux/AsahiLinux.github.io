# Support Asahi Linux

The Asahi Linux project is funded by individuals like you. If you would like to support us financially, head over to our project [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/asahilinux).

Porting Linux to Apple Silicon is no small task. Financial support will allow
us to buy hardware and fund contributors, allowing the project to advance at a
steady pace and ensure that everything is paid the proper attention.
