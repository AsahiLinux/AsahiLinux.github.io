We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of movement in kernel land, as well as some tooling improvements and reverse engineering sessions. At this point, Asahi Linux is usable as a basic Linux desktop (without GPU acceleration)! The ground had been shifting until now, but we&amp;rsquo;re seeing drivers settle down. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what&amp;rsquo;s been going on.
Linux drivers galore Earlier this year we saw the absolute lowest level drivers being merged into the kernel.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: August 2021</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2021/08/progress-report-august-2021/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2021/08/progress-report-august-2021/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since the last update! In all honesty, the first Progress Report set the bar a little bit too high, and I found it difficult to sit down and put together monthly reports that would do it justice. So, going forward, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be providing shorter-form updates while striving to keep a monthly schedule.
That said, a lot has happened in the past few months, so strap in for a bigger update this time!</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: January / February 2021</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-february-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 12:04:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-february-2021/</guid><description>Welcome to the first Asahi Linux Progress Report! In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a page from the Dolphin playbook and giving you monthly updates on the progress of the project.
Bringing up support for a new system-on-chip on Linux is no small task! I hope this series will be educational to everyone and give you a glimpse of the behind-the-scenes work that goes into making Linux work on a brand new device.</description></item></channel></rss>
