Linux 6.19 is now out in the wild and&amp;hellip; ah, let&amp;rsquo;s just cut to the chase. We know what you&amp;rsquo;re here for.
The big one Asahi Linux turns 5 this year. In those five years, we&amp;rsquo;ve gone from Hello World over a serial port to being one of the best supported desktop-grade AArch64 platform in the Linux ecosystem. The sustained interest in Asahi was the push many developers needed to start taking AArch64 seriously, with a whole slew of platform-specific bugs in popular software being fixed specifically to enable their use on Apple Silicon devices running Linux.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: Linux 6.18</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/12/progress-report-6-18/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 11:30:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/12/progress-report-6-18/</guid><description>Linux 6.18 has released, and we have a bit to talk about for this holiday season progress report!
More upstreaming madness Last time, we announced that the core SMC driver had finally been merged upstream after three long years. Following that success, we have started the process of merging the SMC&amp;rsquo;s subdevice drivers which integrate all of the SMC&amp;rsquo;s functionality into the various kernel subsystems. The hwmon driver has already been accepted for 6.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: Linux 6.17</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/10/progress-report-6-17/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 10:30:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/10/progress-report-6-17/</guid><description>Another upstream kernel release means it must be time for a progress report!
The patches keep coming As always, upstreaming continues. The highlight of this cycle is finally landing the SMC core driver, after discussions on the mailing list going all the way back to 2022! Along with the core driver, drivers for the SMC&amp;rsquo;s GPIO controller and reboot controller have also been merged. This allows devices which are already upstream to reboot gracefully, and lays the groundwork for enabling WiFi and Bluetooth upstream.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: Linux 6.16</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/08/progress-report-6-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 22:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/08/progress-report-6-16/</guid><description>With Linux 6.16 now out in the wild, it&amp;rsquo;s time for yet another progress report! As we mentioned last time, the Asahi and Honeykrisp Mesa drivers have finally found their way upstream. This has resulted in a flurry of GPU-related work, so let&amp;rsquo;s start there.
No missing nuts in this Flatpak For quite some time, we have maintained a version of our Mesa driver built against the Flatpak runtime and shipped it as a Flatpak runtime extension.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: Linux 6.15</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/05/progress-report-6-15/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2025 13:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/05/progress-report-6-15/</guid><description>Linux 6.15 is right around the corner, which means it&amp;rsquo;s time for another progress report! We have been pretty busy behind the scenes and we have some exciting developments to share with you all.
Fedora Asahi Remix 42 Release Last time, we announced that Fedora Asahi Remix 42 was close to release. It has since released and is now available to install! The Asahi Installer now offers Fedora Asahi Remix 42 images by default, and existing users on FAR 40 and 41 are encouraged to upgrade using dnf system-upgrade or Plasma&amp;rsquo;s Discover to start enjoying the latest versions of your favourite software.</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: Linux 6.14</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/03/progress-report-6-14/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:00:00 +1000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/03/progress-report-6-14/</guid><description>As March draws to a close and Linux 6.14 nears release, now is a good time to provide you all with our first major progress update since taking the lead on the project. Going forward, we hope to keep these updates in sync with upstream kernel releases. We feel that this is a natural cadence given the focus on upstreaming, with enough time between posts for noteworthy downstream changes to accumulate.</description></item><item><title>Passing the torch on Asahi Linux</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 14:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/</guid><description>With a heavy heart, we announce the resignation of Asahi Linux founder Hector Martin (marcan). His statement is on his blog. Asahi Linux brings Linux to Apple Silicon, supporting audio, webcams, graphics acceleration, and more. As the remaining developers, we are taking this as an opportunity to build sustainable project governance. No matter how talented an individual, a large project cannot rest on a single person&amp;rsquo;s shoulders. So instead of one replacement&amp;hellip; we have seven:</description></item><item><title>Beyond Gaming: X11 bridging in muvm</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2024/12/muvm-x11-bridging/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2024/12/muvm-x11-bridging/</guid><description>Hi everyone! We&amp;rsquo;ve just shipped a really cool update to our x86/x86-64 emulation stack on Asahi Linux, and I wanted to share what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on. As of today, non-game apps are now usable!

Native graphics in VMs As you might remember from our previous blog post, Asahi Linux runs all x86/x86-64 apps in a microVM driven by muvm. How can we manage to run games in a real VM with near-native performance, without hardware GPU passthrough?</description></item><item><title>AAA gaming on Asahi Linux</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2024/10/aaa-gaming-on-asahi-linux/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2024 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2024/10/aaa-gaming-on-asahi-linux/</guid><description>Gaming on Linux on M1 is here! We&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to release our Asahi game playing toolkit, which integrates our Vulkan 1.3 drivers with x86 emulation and Windows compatibility. Plus a bonus: conformant OpenCL 3.0.
Asahi Linux now ships the only conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware. As for gaming&amp;hellip; while today&amp;rsquo;s release is an alpha, Control runs well!
Installation First, install Fedora Asahi Remix. Once installed, get the latest drivers with dnf upgrade --refresh &amp;amp;&amp;amp; reboot.</description></item><item><title>Vulkan 1.3 on the M1 in 1 month</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2024/06/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2024/06/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month/</guid><description>Finally, conformant Vulkan for the M1! The new &amp;ldquo;Honeykrisp&amp;rdquo; driver is the first conformant Vulkan® for Apple hardware on any operating system, implementing the full 1.3 spec without &amp;ldquo;portability&amp;rdquo; waivers.
Honeykrisp is not yet released for end users. We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to add features, improve performance, and port to more hardware. Source code is available for developers.

Unlike the vendor&amp;rsquo;s non-conformant 4.1 drivers, our open source Linux drivers are conformant to the latest OpenGL versions, finally promising broad compatibility with modern OpenGL workloads, like Blender.
Conformant 4.6/3.2 drivers must pass over 100,000 tests to ensure correctness.</description></item><item><title>New in Fedora Asahi Remix</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/</guid><description>We&amp;rsquo;re very proud to have released the first stable release of Fedora Asahi Remix not too long ago, and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to go over everything we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to. You may have wondered what&amp;rsquo;s up with the radio silence for the past few months. The answer is that we&amp;rsquo;ve been busy cramming in as many features as we could into this release. We went quite a bit over our original time estimate (as they say, the last 20% of the work takes 80% of the time), but I don&amp;rsquo;t see anyone complaining about new features.</description></item><item><title>The first conformant M1 GPU driver</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 23:30:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver/</guid><description>Conformant OpenGL® ES 3.1 drivers are now available for M1- and M2-family GPUs.

As you probably know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working together with the rest of the Asahi Linux team on open source GPU drivers for Apple Silicon platforms. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild ride! Just at the end of last year we released the first version of our drivers, after many months of reverse engineering and development. But that was only the beginning&amp;hellip;
Today we&amp;rsquo;re releasing a big update to our GPU drivers for Asahi Linux, so I wanted to talk to you about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on since then, and what&amp;rsquo;s next!</description></item><item><title>Apple GPU drivers now in Asahi Linux</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2022/12/gpu-drivers-now-in-asahi-linux/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 14:50:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2022/12/gpu-drivers-now-in-asahi-linux/</guid><description>Hello everyone! We&amp;rsquo;re excited to announce our first public Apple Silicon GPU driver release!
We&amp;rsquo;ve been working hard over the past two years to bring this new driver to everyone, and we&amp;rsquo;re really proud to finally be here. This is still an alpha driver, but it&amp;rsquo;s already good enough to run a smooth desktop experience and some games.

marcan asked me to write an article about the M1 GPU, so here we are~! It&amp;rsquo;s been a long road over the past few months and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to cover, so I hope you enjoy it!
What&amp;rsquo;s a GPU? You probably know what a GPU is, but do you know how they work under the hood? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look! Almost all modern GPUs have the same main components:</description></item><item><title>Updates galore!

Welcome to another long overdue progress report! As usual, things have been busier than expected… and we have some big news! We’ve just released a new Asahi Linux update with Mac Studio, Bluetooth, and M2 support!</description></item><item><title>The first Asahi Linux Alpha Release is here!</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 23:50:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long while since we updated the blog! Truth be told, we wanted to write a couple more progress reports, but there was always &amp;ldquo;one more thing&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; So, instead, we decided to take the plunge and publish the first public alpha release of the Asahi Linux reference distribution!
We&amp;rsquo;re really excited to finally take this step and start bringing Linux on Apple Silicon to everyone. This is only the beginning, and things will move even more quickly going forward!</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: October-November 2021</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2021/12/progress-report-oct-nov-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2021/12/progress-report-oct-nov-2021/</guid><description>Whoops, things got so busy we ended up skipping a month!

M1 Pro/Max joins the family At the end of October, Apple launched the next generation of Apple Silicon: M1 Pro and M1 Max. We got right to work on supporting these new machines, and after just a few days of work we were able to bring up Asahi Linux on them up to feature parity with the M1 machines!</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: September 2021</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2021/10/progress-report-september-2021/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2021/10/progress-report-september-2021/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy month! We&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of movement in kernel land, as well as some tooling improvements and reverse engineering sessions. At this point, Asahi Linux is usable as a basic Linux desktop (without GPU acceleration)! The ground had been shifting until now, but we&amp;rsquo;re seeing drivers settle down. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at what&amp;rsquo;s been going on.

In all honesty, the first Progress Report set the bar a little bit too high, and I found it difficult to sit down and put together monthly reports that would do it justice. So, going forward, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be providing shorter-form updates while striving to keep a monthly schedule.
That said, a lot has happened in the past few months, so strap in for a bigger update this time!</description></item><item><title>Progress Report: January / February 2021</title><link>https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-february-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 12:04:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-february-2021/</guid><description>Welcome to the first Asahi Linux Progress Report! In this series we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a page from the Dolphin playbook and giving you monthly updates on the progress of the project.
