<summary>As March draws to a close and Linux 6.14 nears release, now is a good time to provide you all with our first major progress update since taking the lead on the project. Going forward, we hope to keep these updates in sync with upstream kernel releases. We feel that this is a natural cadence given the focus on upstreaming, with enough time between posts for noteworthy downstream changes to accumulate. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2025/03/progress-report-6-14/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>With a heavy heart, we announce the resignation of Asahi Linux founder Hector Martin (marcan). His statement is on his blog. Asahi Linux brings Linux to Apple Silicon, supporting audio, webcams, graphics acceleration, and more. As the remaining developers, we are taking this as an opportunity to build sustainable project governance. No matter how talented an individual, a large project cannot rest on a single person&rsquo;s shoulders. So instead of one replacement&mldr; we have seven: <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2025/02/passing-the-torch/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<a class=post-title href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/12/muvm-x11-bridging/>Beyond Gaming: X11 bridging in muvm</a>
<summary>Hi everyone! We&rsquo;ve just shipped a really cool update to our x86/x86-64 emulation stack on Asahi Linux, and I wanted to share what we&rsquo;ve been working on. As of today, non-game apps are now usable!

Native graphics in VMs As you might remember from our previous blog post, Asahi Linux runs all x86/x86-64 apps in a microVM driven by muvm. How can we manage to run games in a real VM with near-native performance, without hardware GPU passthrough? <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/12/muvm-x11-bridging/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<a class=post-title href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/10/aaa-gaming-on-asahi-linux/>AAA gaming on Asahi Linux</a>
<summary>Gaming on Linux on M1 is here! We&rsquo;re thrilled to release our Asahi game playing toolkit, which integrates our Vulkan 1.3 drivers with x86 emulation and Windows compatibility. Plus a bonus: conformant OpenCL 3.0.
Asahi Linux now ships the only conformant OpenGL®, OpenCL™, and Vulkan® drivers for this hardware. As for gaming&mldr; while today&rsquo;s release is an alpha, Control runs well!
Installation First, install Fedora Asahi Remix. Once installed, get the latest drivers with dnf upgrade --refresh && reboot. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/10/aaa-gaming-on-asahi-linux/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>Finally, conformant Vulkan for the M1! The new &ldquo;Honeykrisp&rdquo; driver is the first conformant Vulkan® for Apple hardware on any operating system, implementing the full 1.3 spec without &ldquo;portability&rdquo; waivers.
Honeykrisp is not yet released for end users. We&rsquo;re continuing to add features, improve performance, and port to more hardware. Source code is available for developers.
HoloCure running on Honeykrisp ft. DXVK, FEX, and Proton. Honeykrisp is not based on prior M1 Vulkan efforts, but rather Faith Ekstrand&rsquo;s open source NVK driver for NVIDIA GPUs. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/06/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>For years, the M1 has only supported OpenGL 4.1. That changes today &ndash; with our release of full OpenGL® 4.6 and OpenGL® ES 3.2! Install Fedora for the latest M1/M2-series drivers.
Already installed? Just dnf upgrade --refresh.
Unlike the vendor&rsquo;s non-conformant 4.1 drivers, our open source Linux drivers are conformant to the latest OpenGL versions, finally promising broad compatibility with modern OpenGL workloads, like Blender.
Conformant 4.6/3.2 drivers must pass over 100,000 tests to ensure correctness. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/02/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>We&rsquo;re very proud to have released the first stable release of Fedora Asahi Remix not too long ago, and now it&rsquo;s time to go over everything we&rsquo;ve been up to. You may have wondered what&rsquo;s up with the radio silence for the past few months. The answer is that we&rsquo;ve been busy cramming in as many features as we could into this release. We went quite a bit over our original time estimate (as they say, the last 20% of the work takes 80% of the time), but I don&rsquo;t see anyone complaining about new features. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2024/01/fedora-asahi-new/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>Conformant OpenGL® ES 3.1 drivers are now available for M1- and M2-family GPUs. That means the drivers are compatible with any OpenGL ES 3.1 application. Interested? Just install Linux!
For existing Asahi Linux users, upgrade your system with dnf upgrade (Fedora) or pacman -Syu (Arch) for the latest drivers.
Our reverse-engineered, free and open source graphics drivers are the world&rsquo;s only conformant OpenGL ES 3.1 implementation for M1- and M2-family graphics hardware. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>You&rsquo;ve all been waiting for it, many of you have guessed, and now, as announced at Flock To Fedora, it&rsquo;s time to make it official:
The new Asahi Linux flagship distribution will be Fedora Asahi Remix!
We&rsquo;re confident that this new flagship will get us much closer to our goal of a polished Linux experience on Apple Silicon, and we hope you will enjoy using it as much as we&rsquo;re enjoying working on it. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2023/08/fedora-asahi-remix/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>Upgrade your Asahi Linux systems, because your graphics drivers are getting a big boost: leapfrogging from OpenGL 2.1 over OpenGL 3.0 up to OpenGL 3.1! Similarly, the OpenGL ES 2.0 support is bumping up to OpenGL ES 3.0. That means more playable games and more functioning applications.
Back in December, I teased an early screenshot of SuperTuxKart&rsquo;s deferred renderer working on Asahi, using OpenGL ES 3.0 features like multiple render targets and instancing. <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2023/06/opengl-3-1-on-asahi-linux/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>Hello everyone, Asahi Lina here!✨
As you probably know, I&rsquo;ve been working together with the rest of the Asahi Linux team on open source GPU drivers for Apple Silicon platforms. It&rsquo;s been a wild ride! Just at the end of last year we released the first version of our drivers, after many months of reverse engineering and development. But that was only the beginning&mldr;
Today we&rsquo;re releasing a big update to our GPU drivers for Asahi Linux, so I wanted to talk to you about what we&rsquo;ve been working on since then, and what&rsquo;s next! <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2023/03/road-to-vulkan/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

marcan asked me to write an article about the M1 GPU, so here we are~! It&rsquo;s been a long road over the past few months and there&rsquo;s a lot to cover, so I hope you enjoy it!
What&rsquo;s a GPU? You probably know what a GPU is, but do you know how they work under the hood? Let&rsquo;s take a look! Almost all modern GPUs have the same main components: <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2022/11/tales-of-the-m1-gpu/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>It&rsquo;s been a long while since we updated the blog! Truth be told, we wanted to write a couple more progress reports, but there was always &ldquo;one more thing&rdquo;&mldr; So, instead, we decided to take the plunge and publish the first public alpha release of the Asahi Linux reference distribution!
We&rsquo;re really excited to finally take this step and start bringing Linux on Apple Silicon to everyone. This is only the beginning, and things will move even more quickly going forward! <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2022/03/asahi-linux-alpha-release/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>

<summary>It&rsquo;s been a busy month! We&rsquo;ve had a lot of movement in kernel land, as well as some tooling improvements and reverse engineering sessions. At this point, Asahi Linux is usable as a basic Linux desktop (without GPU acceleration)! The ground had been shifting until now, but we&rsquo;re seeing drivers settle down. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what&rsquo;s been going on.

<summary>It&rsquo;s been a long time since the last update! In all honesty, the first Progress Report set the bar a little bit too high, and I found it difficult to sit down and put together monthly reports that would do it justice. So, going forward, we&rsquo;re going to be providing shorter-form updates while striving to keep a monthly schedule.
That said, a lot has happened in the past few months, so strap in for a bigger update this time! <a href=https://asahilinux.org/2021/08/progress-report-august-2021/ title="Read more">... </a></summary>
